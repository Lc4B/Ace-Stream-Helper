# Ace Stream Helper
Support script for ace streams and [mpv-acestream](https://github.com/Digitalone1/mpv-acestream) script (required).

## How it works
Ace Stream Helper recognizes if an ace stream is started, if so it automatically starts the engine and reloads the stream so that it is reproduced correctly, furthermore when the ace streams or mpv are shutdown it closes the engine and deletes the cache folder.

## Installation
Place the [`Ace_Stream_Helper.lua`](https://github.com/Lc4B/Ace-Stream-Helper/blob/main/Ace_Stream_Helper.lua) file into mpv `scripts` folder.

## Info
This script uses the default locations for engine and cache folder.
